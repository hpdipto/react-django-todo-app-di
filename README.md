# React + Django To-Do App | Django REST Framework

This source code is taken from Dennis Ivy's [React + Django To-Do App | Django REST Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9BjUoot2Eo) tutorial.

This is really a nice tutorial to learn about a full stack project with Django backend.

I highly recommend this tutorial to anyone who wanted to learn about Django with React.
